# Project 4: Around The U.S.

And now, we code!!

Project 4 is an introduction to Javascript. We learned about a few new things:

* DOM - Document Object Model

* Getting data from HTML with querySelector()

* Editing HTML markup with innerHTML and editing classes

* Creating event handlers to update the markup when a button is clicked
